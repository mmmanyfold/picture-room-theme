    At Picture Room, we sell work by emerging and established contemporary artists as well as rare
    prints, posters, artists' books, & art publications. We scour private collections, galleries,
    and institutions, and work with individual artists to discover and showcase works that might
    not otherwise find their way into a traditional retail environment. It's our mission to provide
    access to a diverse, researched, relevant collection in an open and informed environment. We
    work with interior designers, art advisorts and identity consultants to make their experience
    buying artwork for specific projects fluid and simple.
