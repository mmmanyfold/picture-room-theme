        Dan Graham’s show marked the opening of Picture Room's doors and the inception of our Featured Artist program. To compliment Graham’s Roof Garden Commission for the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Picture Room presented a selection of print editions by Graham showing sketches made for site specific architectural structures. Additionally, Graham brought two iconic works exclusively to Picture Room, Figurative (1965/1994) and New Piece (1972).

        For her Featured Artist show, Domm produced an exclusive Picture Room edition titled Blue Stars, which was shown alongside two screen prints and three original drawings. The featured work involved images of woven objects: rugs, baskets, and fabric patterns - all exemplary of Domm’s central exploration of the relationship between art and the natural world. Meditations on the handmade, her prints and drawings are often composed of repetitious smaller units, reminiscent of stitches or woven threads.

        The design duo was founded in 2006 by David Reinfurt and Stuart Bailey as a “Just-in-Time Workshop & Occasional Bookstore” in a Ludlow Street basement in New York. A publishing collaborative that effectively collapses the roles of designer, publisher, and distributor, Dexter Sinister’s approach to creating work is a comment on the world of contemporary commercial publishing and the prevailing excess of the current art market.

        Inside Picture Room, publishing duo Dexter Sinister presented a portfolio of nine images from the W.A.S.T.E. series. The prints were produced in an edition of 25 as black-on-white B1 format lithographs by Linnetts Proofing, London, with the exception of one silk-screened aluminum plaque. Each piece borrowed from a pre-existing text or image and re-appropriated them in the gallery setting as large format art works.

        A selection of Cameron's work from her solo show Who You at Room East was on display at Picture Room. The colorful works were selected from a body of artwork titled Everything is Everything and exhibit the artist's ability to combine text and image while exploring personal identity and the human psyche, specifically the overlap of personality types and interchangeability of these characteristics. Most notable are references to the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, though Cameron also sites Ad Reinhardt and Amy Sillman's lightbulb comics as inspiration. “The initial straight idea was to create an identity system for an identity system,” says Cameron. “I was also interested in the reason why the Myers-Briggs women wanted to create the test in order to help women enter the workforce after World War II.”

        Teaming up with Richard Kostelanetz for his Featured Artist show, Picture Room published a new edition, String Two In Four Parts: a letter pressed four-part visual poem. Characteristic of the style of "visual poetry" Kostelanetz championed since the 1970s, this string of words is composed as a spiral that prompts the poem to be held in one's hand, turned, and read. This new work was shown in conjunction with a largely unseen suite of silkscreen prints made by Kostelanetz in 1974 for Cory Gallery, known as the Numbers One Portfolio, which together bracket four decades of his significant contribution to poetry and art.

For the months of July and August, Picture Room presented Benjamin Critton's bold DOT series in previously unseen variations and colors, including a shimmering gold screen-printed edition of 20, made exclusively for Picture Room. Critton’s DOT series exhibits his keen design sense and appropriation of the everyday. A nod to New York gallerist Leo Castelli - one of the first dealers to place sticker dots next to artwork he wished to purchase - Critton’s prints are void of the signifying context that otherwise endow the form with cultural symbolism. These works explore the shifting interpretations that are put into effect through adjustments to arrangement, scale, and color. A formal play on the familiar, they are celebratory in their own right as an homage to the essential principles of art-making and design.

Pia Howell presented a new series of C-prints, Hollywood Rd., using her signature color darkroom process on the occasion of her Featured Artist show at Picture Room. With reference to Hong Kong’s antiques market, Hollywood Road, Howell drew inspiration from classical eastern and western elements to create a visual language of universally relatable iconography. To create her prints, she painted directly on to transparencies, then contact-printed onto photo paper by exposing the paper to color-filtered light in the darkroom. The resulting works have a simplicity of form that deviates fluidly between abstraction and representation and renders the familiar unfamiliar.

A continuation of the 120 designs collected in her 2012 book To The Extend Of / \ | & -, Sigrid Calon worked with Picture Room to create a set of 9 prints that draw from the minimal 3x3 dot system of an embroidery grid, resulting in 8 different stitch combinations. Adopting this structure digitally by transforming stitches into lines, a new set of graphic rules came into play: lines could repeat, combine, intersect, silhouette, and layer. Finally, when printed through the process of Risography, depth, gradients, and patterns appeared in colors existing outside of the CMYK color sphere. For the Picture Room edition, Calon introduced fluorescent orange and grey in addition to her previous 8-color combination. The resulting prints - made in an edition of 25 - are vibrant, playful, and rhythmic investigations of structure and experimentation.
