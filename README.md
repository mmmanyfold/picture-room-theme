##Updating Staff Picks

- Open [staff_picks.html](https://github.com/mmmanyfold/picture-room-theme/blob/master/staff_picks.html)

- Anything inside of <!--  --> is a comment. Comments are ignored by the browser (for humans only). They don't affect the webpage.

- Each personâ€™s section is marked with a comment (look for their name):
	```
	<!-- ## EDIT SANDEEP'S PICKS BELOW -->
	```
- Their picks are organized within rows and columns, which are also marked:
	```
	<!-- ## ROW 1 -->

		<!-- ## ROW 1, COLUMN 1 -->
		<!-- ## ROW 1, COLUMN 2 -->

	<!-- ## ROW 2 -->

		<!-- ## ROW 2, COLUMN 1 -->
		<!-- ## ROW 2, COLUMN 2 -->
	```
- Each item contains the following:
	```
	<!-- ## EDIT PRODUCT URL -->

	<!-- ## EDIT PRODUCT IMAGE URL -->

	<!-- ## EDIT PRODUCT URL, ARTIST NAME, AND PRODUCT NAME -->
	```
- Click the pencil icon to start editing. Edit the code as needed here on Github, so we always have a backup of the most recent version.

- When you're done making changes, copy-paste the complete updated code into Lightspeed:

	1. Log in to: http://pictureroom.mcnallyjacksonstore.com/store/admin/login

	2. Go to **Custom Pages > Staff Picks**

	3. Click the **< >** icon under **Edit Page Content** to switch to HTML view

	4. Replace everything with updated code and click **Save**.

- Check the [Staff Picks page](http://pictureroom.mcnallyjacksonstore.com/store/staff-picks) to make sure everything looks right. Edit the code if necessary - always edit in Github and then copy paste into Lightspeed to test your changes.

- Once everything checks out, save the code in Github - scroll to the bottom and enter a descriptive commit message (ie. *update Milah's picks*). Then commit changes.

- If you need to change anything later on, always make sure to include a commit message (ie. *fix typo*)

##Updating Featured Artist

- First upload the new featured artist poster via FTP (Cyberduck).

- Open [featured_artist.html](https://github.com/mmmanyfold/picture-room-theme/blob/master/featured_artist.html)

- Click the pencil icon to start editing. Edit the code here on Github, so we always have a backup of the most recent version.

- Line 2 - Write down the 6-digit color hex code from the `style` property, we're going to need this later in the Previous Artists section). Then replace this hex code with the new one* and change the artist name (hyphenated) in `data-brand`.<br>
	*&ast;To get the hex code, open the poster in Photoshop and use the [Eyedropper tool](https://css-tricks.com/grabbing-hex-codes-for-colors/) to select the color you want*<br>
	Line 3 - Change the artist name and dates (no month abbrevs).<br>
	Line 6 - In the image path, change the number and artist name.<br>
	Line 9 - Replace artist bio.<br>
	Line 13 - Replace series description.<br>
	Line 18 - Replace series title.

- To move the current artist into the Previous Artists section, paste the following template into line 26 and replace every instance of the artist first/last name. Replace hex code with the one from earlier!

	```
		<div class="col-sm-4">
			<a href="/store/brand/leanne-shapton" style="color:#c4d3e6">
			<img src="/store/images/artists/PR-Posters-10-Leanne_Shapton.jpg" alt="Leanne Shapton">
			2016.X
			</a>
		</div>
	```

	Make sure the number in the image path is correct, I always mess this up :p
	Don't forget to change the year and Roman numeral as well.

- When you're done making changes, copy-paste the complete updated code into Lightspeed:

	1. Log in to: http://pictureroom.mcnallyjacksonstore.com/store/admin/login

	2. Go to **Custom Pages > Featured Artist**

	3. Click the **< >** icon under **Edit Page Content** to switch to HTML view

- Once everything checks out, save the code in Github - scroll to the bottom and enter a descriptive commit message (ie. *add new featured artist Maia Ruth Lee*). Then commit changes.

##README for Brooklyn2014 theme

Thank you for taking the time to read this file.
Below are some very important notes on how to make changes to the look of your web store.

If you have opened this file from the original brooklyn2014 theme, DO NOT, manually modify ANY of the files in this folder.
The Brooklyn2014 theme may get updated automatically and any changes you make will be lost.

To begin designing a custom theme, use the following directions:

1. Go to Admin Panel and choose the Themes menu.
2. Click on "Manage My Themes".
3. Ensure brooklyn2014 is selected and *click the "Copy selected theme for customization" button. This makes a copy of the brooklyn2014 and switches Web Store to use it.

At this point, you can make changes to the files in the newly created brooklyn2014copy folder as you desire.

What files you change depends on what types of changes you're trying to make. If you are simply wanting to adjust some colors,
our highest recommendation is to use the Edit CSS feature under Themes in the Admin Panel. Copy elements from the other theme files
or make new elements and add them to custom.css. The elements in custom.css will take priority.

Your copy of the brooklyn2014 will contain a folder 'views' with files from the theme's core viewset.
For major changes including layout, you can adjust/amend these files.

The system works like "onion layers". If it finds the file in the theme, that's what it uses. If it's missing, it goes back to the equivalent file under the /protected folder. For this reason, you never have to modify a protected file because your theme always takes priority.

A final note, once you are happy with your changes,
1. Navigate to the Admin Panel, choose the Themes menu.
2. Click on "Manage My Themes".
3. Ensure your brooklyn2014copy is selected and *click the "Remove Unchanged Files from selected theme". This will remove any files
that are identical to their parents in the core. Thus, if changes are made to those core files, your theme automatically picks them up as well.

In summary: Never modify anything under /protected/views-cities3 or under /themes/brooklyn2014.
Keep all your customizations under your own theme folder. This will allow you to have a great Web Store that can be continuously updated automatically and you'll never run into conflicts.
